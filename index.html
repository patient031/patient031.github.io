            Hello! My name is Patient Tuyishime. I am a passionate web developer and a senior student at Midway University. I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration. I love creating beautiful and functional web applications!

            Besides web development, I have played soccer for Midway University, which has taught me teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills. I am also a caregiver at Comfortable Living Nursing Home, where I provide compassionate care to individuals with brain injuries.
